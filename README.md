# Action Mill

ActionMill is a small proof of concept .NET library I am developing that will help turn workflows into a managed queue of action, where you choose how many actions can run in parallel then the library handles timing, scheduling and logging with full control over each action to pause, resume, and cancel with the ability to specify custom behavior of what happens once execution is over.
